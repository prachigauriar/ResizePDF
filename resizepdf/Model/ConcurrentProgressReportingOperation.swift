/// `ConcurrentProgressReportingOperation` is an abstract class that provides the basic boilerplate

/// and adds read/write properties for `executing` and `finished` so that subclasses can easily set
/// operation state in their `start` methods. 
/// 
/// As a conveneince, the class also conforms to `ProgressReporting`.
